# golang_escape_analysis_test
Testing golang escape analysis test for Web Development class, Spring 2023

The escape analysis is one of the phases of the Go compiler. It analyses the source code and determines what variables should be allocated on the stack and which ones should escape to the heap.

We tried to test and analize go behaviour in a few examples in class, in order to get deeper insight of call by reference, call by value, pointers and address alocation concepts in WebDev class.

This repo contains the code and the result of that experiment.
